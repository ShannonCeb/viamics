 TODO list for Viamics:

 Features waiting to be implemented, things asking for attention and other
important stuff that should not be forgotten.

--

(****)

 - Installation shouldn't be a big hassle.
 - User manual with some toy runs, hypothesis testing examples, et cetera.
 - Exception handling should be improved.
 - UNIFRAC analysis and introspection (fairly easy, QIIME could provide
 enough inspiration).
 - Interface for exporting analysis results (as PDF or, stand-alone static
 web page).

--

(***)

 - Code needs serious documentation.
 - Unit tests should be finished and complete.
 - User inputs should be checked (is_fasta(), is_qpcr(), is_env(),
 is_sample_map_valid() and similar control functions should be implemented).
 - ANOVA/MANOVA analysis for sample maps comparing more than 2 groups.
 - OTU exclusion (just like sample exclusion) while defining a sample map.
 - Support for PhyloCHIP and MicroArray data.
